          <p>
            Frontend developer with 5 years experience,I create successful
            websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices.

            I work to make a better web; one that is fast, easy to use,
            beautiful, accessible to all. I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
            produce responsive websites and web apps that provide users the best
            and most appropriate experience suited to their device and browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a special interest in use of animation on the web. I
            particularly like working on websites that have seamless transitions
            and require high-level performance to maintain a smooth and
            appealing website.
